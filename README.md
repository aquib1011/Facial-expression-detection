# Facial expression detection

To recognize facial expressions using convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
